These directory contains some handy Prolog scripts:

Before you use them, be sure to have setup paths correctly in the top-level lost.pl file.

* ptt_to_prolog.pl 
==================

This is a small Prolog program which converts from Genbank PTT format to an internal
Prolog format. 

To run the program, first start PRISM, and at the interactive prompt type:

| ?- [ptt_to_prolog].

... This will load the program ...

Then, when you get the prompt again type,

| ?- ptt_to_prolog('../data/U00096.ptt','../data/U00096.ptt.pl').

This is the command used to produce U00096.ptt.pl which is located in the data
directory. The first argument in the input (PTT) file and the second argument
is the name of a file where output is written to.

* genemark_to_prolog.pl 
=======================

This is a small Prolog program which converts from Genemark report format format to an internal
Prolog format. 

To run the program, first start PRISM, and at the interactive prompt type:

| ?- [genemark_to_prolog].

... This will load the program ...

Then, when you get the prompt again type,

| ?- genemark_to_prolog('../data/genemark_report_ecoli','../data/genemark_report_ecoli.pl').

This is the command used to produce genemark_report_ecoli.pl (or overwrite it, if it is there) 
which is located in the data directory. The first argument in the input file and the second argument
is the name of a file where output is written to.
