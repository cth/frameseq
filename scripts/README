These directory contains some handy Prolog scripts:

* ptt_to_prolog.pl 
==================

This is a small Prolog program which converts from Genbank PTT format to an internal
Prolog format. 

To run the program, first start PRISM, and at the interactive prompt type:

| ?- [ptt_to_prolog].

... This will load the program ...

Then, when you get the prompt again type,

| ?- ptt_to_prolog('../data/U00096.ptt','../data/U00096.ptt.pl').

This is the command used to produce U00096.ptt.pl which is located in the data
directory. The first argument in the input (PTT) file and the second argument
is the name of a file where output is writted to.
